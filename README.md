# To-Do List App (React.js)

Welcome to the repository of my **To-Do List App** built with React.js. This dynamic and interactive task manager helps users efficiently track, update, and delete daily tasks.

**Live Demo:**  
Click [here](https://sushilkumar567.github.io/7-todo-list-app/) to see the live version of the app.

## Key Highlights:

**React-Based Architecture:**  
Component-driven approach using functional components and hooks for clean and maintainable code.

**Full CRUD Functionality (In-Memory State):**

- **Create:** Add new tasks.
- **Read:** View a list of all tasks.
- **Update:** Edit tasks in place.
- **Delete:** Remove tasks individually.

**Smart Validations:**  
Prevents adding empty tasks using `trim()` and alerts the user if the input is blank.

**Responsive UI:**  
Simple, mobile-friendly layout using CSS3 for styling.

**Hooks in Action:**

- `useState` to manage task list, input field, and edit mode.
- `Conditional rendering` used to toggle between "Add Task" and "Edit Task" buttons.

## Technologies Used:

**React.js:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

**JSX:** Syntax extension for writing HTML-like tags in JavaScript.

**CSS3:** Used for styling components with responsive and modern design.
